r: how to do case sensitive string replacement

r: most used german words








DECISIONS

turn translation div into textarea too? (uneditable)

word based or sentence based? (including complex grammar)
  for now: word based

better UI
  arrow from left to right?

case to handle: empty input text







TODOS

implement 'zusammenfassende wortfolgen' logic

better responsiveness

requirement: translation must preserve formatting (punctuation, line breaks,...)

case to handle: very long input words (no spaces) can screw with output overflow

case to handle: output gets displayed correctly for really long text
